# This module is reserved for future networking features.
# It will allow nodes to communicate over HTTP or gRPC,
# sending and receiving block proposals and votes.
#
# Planned Use Cases:
#   - Proposer node broadcasts a new block to validators
#   - Validator nodes receive and verify blocks
#   - Nodes exchange votes or confirmations
#
# Dependencies to consider later:
#   - Flask / FastAPI (for REST)
#   - gRPC (for high-performance communication)
#   - requests / httpx (for sending HTTP requests)
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Placeholder for now
print("Network module placeholder. Implement this when going multi-node.")
