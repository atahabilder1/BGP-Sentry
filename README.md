# 🛡️ BGP-Sentry: Expanding BGP Trust to Non-RPKI ASes via  RPKI-enabled ASes as Observers

## 📚 Overview
**BGP-Sentry** is a blockchain-based simulation framework designed to secure and audit BGP announcements beyond RPKI coverage. It leverages RPKI-enabled Autonomous Systems (ASes), which represent approximately 60% of global ASes, as observers to validate the behavior of neighboring non-RPKI ASes.

The system employs a dual-blockchain architecture:
- **Blockchain A**: A permissioned local ledger where RPKI nodes validate and record BGP announcements.
- **Blockchain B**: A public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) hosting smart contracts that enable non-RPKI nodes to stake USDC tokens for credibility.

Each non-RPKI AS is assigned a dynamic trust score and classified into tiers:
- **Trusted** (≥ 80)
- **Under Observation** (30–79)
- **Distrusted** (≤ 30)

RPKI nodes collect announcements from simulated router logs (generated by Mininet), assess them via verification and historical behavior analysis, and then enforce security using both real-time penalties and periodic trust score updates.

> Note: In this simulation, BGP announcements are not directly emitted by non-RPKI nodes but are generated through Mininet and parsed into each AS's `network_stack/` as if they originated from actual routers.

## 🔐 Trust Architecture

### ✅ Trust Score Model
- **Initial trust** for non-RPKI nodes = 70
- **Minimum accepted trust** = 70
- **Penalty for hijack** = -30 (immediate)
- **Periodic adjustment**:
  - Reward: +5 per good cycle
  - Penalty: -10 per suspicious cycle
- **Stake-based boost**:
  - Stake 100 USDC if trust ≥ 50 and < 70
  - Temporary boost: +20

### 🔑 Trust Engine Logic
Located in:
```
nodes/rpki_nodes/shared_blockchain_stack/utils/trust_engine/
```
- Applies real-time penalties (e.g., for hijacks)
- Performs periodic trust adjustment (e.g., monthly)

## ⚖️ Blockchain Models

### ⛓️ Blockchain A (TrustChain)
- Permissioned private chain
- Stores full BGP announcement records
- Operated by RPKI-enabled nodes
- Located in:
```
nodes/rpki_nodes/shared_blockchain_stack/shared_data/chain/
```

### ₵ Blockchain B (Public USDC Staking)
- Smart contract on Ethereum/Solana
- Allows non-RPKI nodes to stake USDC
- Used for trust boosting
- Interacted with by `stake_engine/`

## 🔮 How to Run

### 1. Set up Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate BGP Logs
```bash
python bgp_feed/mininet_logs/simulator.py
```
> Simulated announcements will be written to `nodes/rpki_nodes/*/network_stack/`

### 3. Run RPKI Node
```bash
python nodes/rpki_nodes/as01/blockchain_node/main.py --asn 65001
```

### 4. Update Trust Scores
```bash
python nodes/rpki_nodes/shared_blockchain_stack/utils/trust_engine/main.py
```

### 5. Deploy Smart Contract (Blockchain B)
```bash
cd smart_contract/
python scripts/deploy_and_test.py
```

## 💼 Major Responsibilities
| Component Path | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `blockchain_node/` | Proposes blocks, validates and writes announcements |
| `shared_blockchain_stack/` | Manages Blockchain A: proposing, consensus, logging |
| `trust_engine/` | Adjusts trust scores using logs and penalties |
| `stake_engine/` | Reads on-chain stake data from Blockchain B |
| `network_stack/` | Receives and stores simulated BGP logs |
| `bgp_feed/mininet_logs/` | Generator of all BGP test input logs (Not being used now)|
| `shared_data/` | Stores blockchain chain, trust state, and registries |

---

## 🧠 Realism Assumptions
- Each `asXX/` folder models a router stack (Mininet + validation agent)
- All announcements come from **Mininet logs**, not directly from non-RPKI nodes
- Only **RPKI first-hop nodes** write to the blockchain
- Withdrawals and hijacks follow the same logging and trust rules

---

## 📄 For Research or Reports
- Emphasize dual blockchain design
  - Blockchain A: permissioned, local
  - Blockchain B: public, stake-based
- Trust score is dynamic and based on behavior
- Mininet simulates real-world topology and attack scenarios
